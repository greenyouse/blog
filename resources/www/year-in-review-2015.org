* TODOs for next year
  - Get better at PHP, Java, Shen, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure(Script), and
    JavaScript.
  - Understand more of the math behind Category Theory and how to
    practically apply it to software development.
  - Write a library on top of cat-theory operations that makes data
    transformations easy.
  - Try Writing ElasticSearch and SQL libraries on top of the cat-theory
    library.
  - Use Erlang to build a proper implementation of the phantom protocol.
  - Figure out a decent way to abstract app development across platforms
    (started this but haven't touched it since last spring and it could
    use a lot of work).
  - Have fun in general with some new projects!
