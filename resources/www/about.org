#+TITLE: About Me

I'm a developer from the Upper Midwest that loves coding, rock climbing,
cooking, and skiing. My focus is on building web applications and
learning as much as possible about different tools, techniques, and
programming paradigms.

Most recently I founded a hotel booking service for people with
disabilities. The goal was to give travelers with special needs the
ability to easily book trips for themselves.  While working on the
startup I participated in the first batch of YC's Startup School. After
one year of building the startup, I'm going back to working as a
software engineer.
