A little after Christmas I came up with a startup idea for a problem
I've had. From around New Year's up to last week I did some rapid fire
user research and a mini design sprint (hey, I only have a team of one
person, me) to judge the risk associated with the idea. From my small,
potentially biased data set I've determined that this idea was good
enough to work on in my free time (when not applying for jobs or
studying).

I'm just sinking my teeth into the front-end engineering part of the app
and I want to outline some of the approach that I'm taking since I
think it might be helpful for others. I'd be interested if you have any
feedback too.

For the past year I've decided to specialize in Web Components and the
Polymer framework. The most significant advantage that I've seen to
doing this approach has been the self-documenting nature of Polymer's
components. When writing code you can do a simple ~polymer serve~ to get
an auto-generated documentation page for your component and access to
demo pages (they look like this: [[https://greenyouse.github.io/datetime-local-input/components/datetime-local-input/][datetime-local-input]] or [[https://www.webcomponents.org/element/greenyouse/bottom-nav][bottom-nav]]).

Taking this approach is somewhat similar to generating a [[http://styleguides.io/][living style
guide]] (here's a more in-depth article on style guides: [[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/creating-a-living-style-guide-case-study/][style guide case
study]]). Each component is well defined and reused throughout the
app. Styles can also be encapsulated in their own component and shared
with the ShadowDOM. Almost anything can be used as a component so it's
easy to build up a style guide for CSS themes, color palettes, and other
things, not just UI elements.

In the past I've jammed all my components into one app repository and
ended up with a bit of a mess. This is a common practice but I decided
to break most of my components into their own projects this time. I
think there's a huge advantage to having each component tracked in GIT
for versioning. It also simplifies the testing and component demos.

Generating a style guide for all these repos becomes a little trickier
by doing this though. The Polymer analyzer that builds documentation
only works at the project level. Luckily the Polymer team already solved
this problem with their [[https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-element-catalog][Polymer Element Catalog]]. This pulls in
collections of web components and generates an easy to navigate site for
them (here's the now deprecated [[https://elements.polymer-project.org/][element catalog site]]). You'll need to
tweak it for your own elements but it's not too bad to set up.

This is very much having your cake and eating it too! I can generate
documentation for my components, classify them into collections, share
consistent styling, easily write component demos, and have each
component tracked nicely in version control.

Investing the time to develop a robust living style guide at a
startup from day one would usually be a horrible idea. However, with
Polymer I can build out a style guide while I code the app. The only
actual work is writing some demos and doing the element catalog. I've
never done a full living style guide for an app before but this seems
like it has to be the path of least resistance.

If this startup business ever gets made and is popular, I can reap the
benefits of having a decent style guide without the arduous work that
usually entails.

For now I've written out the site map and wireframes, gotten some
production quality elements coded, and am going to start open sourcing a
few back to the community. I think it's good to share elements because
it forces me to care about the quality. Not that I don't usually care,
it's just I'm in a time crunch trying to kick out an MVP within the next
couple months in-case I don't find a job. I'm also super appreciative
for the awesome components that others have shared and the continuing
maintenance they offer, so I'd like a way to give back a bit.

There are probably a bunch of things about startup stuff that I could
post about and Web Components are a cool topic to blog about too. Leave
a comment if you want me to cover anything in a future post. I'm not
really in the rhythm of blogging regularly so it could be a while before
posting again.

Hope this was fun to read through and makes you try out the Polymer
framework if you haven't yet!
