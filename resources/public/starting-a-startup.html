<h1 class="title">Starting a Startup</h1>
<p>
When you start something new you don't know what you don't know. If it's
your first time building a startup there are some basic things that go
against common knowledge or might be the opposite of what you'd usually
do at a regular job. If you're already in a startup hub like Silicon
Valley or New York City, then you can probably find a mentor and
leverage the startup culture there. If you're in a city where software
engineers are uncommon and tech startups are rare, having advice on how to
start might help.
</p>

<p>
My education is from YC's online startup school, a bunch of books, and
going out and doing it. I got through most of the initial development
stage and stopped short of launching. The advice below is for early
phase development since that's what I worked through.
</p>

<p>
Everything but the iffy advice on the bottom is good and should apply
to all startups. This is a 101 for how to start a business with
details I wish I would've known when I started.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-1">LLC or C-Corp?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-1">
<p>
Startups are usually filed legally as either LLCs or C-Corps. The
basic rule for which to do is this:
</p>

<p>
Choose C-Corp when taking funding.
</p>

<p>
Choose LLC when bootstrapping.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-2">Which State to File In?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-2">
<p>
Unless you're already a lawyer and know what you're doing, just stick
to the basics. Delaware is the state that people usually use because
they have a special court system that expedites business cases. VCs
will usually want you to be in Delaware before giving you
money. Moving states after you're already established can be a pain
too, so just keep it simple.
</p>

<p>
The only exception to this would be if you want to start an anonymous
company for a more taboo industry. In that case Nevada has and
anonymous LLC where your name isn't publicly listed as owner.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-3">How to File?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-3">
<p>
Legal companies automate the process of incorporating your
business. They'll charge a bit for the work but it's not much and if
you're successful it'll be much cheaper than having to redo it with a
$300/hr lawyer because you fudged details when filing.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of companies but I'm just going to recommend what I
know works:
</p>

<p>
Choose Clerky for a C-Corp.
</p>

<p>
Choose Incorporate.com for an LLC.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-4">Find a Co-Founder</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-4">
<p>
Co-Founder problems are the #1 killer of startups so pick
carefully. Identify your strengths and weaknesses as a founder. Try
to find someone that fills in your weak spots so together your
founding team doesn't have skill gaps.
</p>

<p>
You should have history with the person you're teaming with so you
know if you'll work well together.
</p>

<p>
Co-Founder sources (ranked best to worst):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>best friend
</li>
<li>co-worker
</li>
<li>acquaintance
</li>
<li>stranger
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-5">What Does Your Company Do?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-5">
<p>
Make a 1-2 sentence explanation for what your company does. It should
be straight to the point. Memorize it so you can answer the chronic
company question for friends, family, VCs, peers, and everybody
else.
</p>

<p>
example:
"BonNochi is a hotel booking service for travelers with
disabilities. We book accessible hotel rooms and guarantee in-room
accessibility features for your trip!"
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-6">Make Money</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-6">
<p>
Bootstrapping helps here but your company has to make money. Maybe
you can raise rounds for a bit but eventually you'll need to be in
the black.
</p>

<p>
Pick something with good margins and reasonable overhead costs.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-7">Validate First</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-7">
<p>
Do UX research to understand what you'll need to build before doing
development. It's easy to change ideas or designs when you haven't
spent the last two months writing code.
</p>

<p>
You also want to solve actual problems that lots of people have. If
you're not solving a problem nobody should use your app. If your
target demographic is too small, you're not going to grow much.
</p>

<p>
Potential customers need to be sold on the idea when they're giving
you feedback. Look for things like:
</p>

<p>
"When will your product be released?"
</p>

<p>
"Can we sign up for updates on your release?"
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-8">Test designs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-8">
<p>
Once you know what to build you'll probably want to test the app
designs. You could do user testing after months of development or you
could hack together some design mockups in a few days. One is cheap
and easy to change, the other not so much.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-9">Product Development Pipeline</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-9">
<p>
figure out what to build -&gt; design it -&gt; spec it -&gt; build it
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-10">Focus on One Thing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-10">
<p>
Starting out is hard. You'll probably start by dreaming big but you
have to be as quick to market as possible. Take the most critical
feature of your service and just build that. Good targets are the
things that make the most profit, have the most social impact, or
are the most requested during UX research.
</p>

<p>
Make this one thing 10x better than anybody else can do it.
</p>

<p>
Punt on the hard stuff.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-11" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-11">Figure Out HATED Things</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-11">
<p>
Still stuck on what to build? Try to figure out what people HATE.
</p>

<p>
During UX research did people have one thing that was horrible to
deal with? Build that.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-12">KPI == Business Health</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-12">
<p>
KPI is startup speak for "Key Performance Indicator" which is mumbo
jumbo speak for "a key metric that tracks your company health
well". Pick an important metric and use it as a proxy for your
company's health.
</p>

<p>
If you get big use multiple metrics.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-0-13" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-0-13">Don't Overwork</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-0-13">
<p>
What's better than doing caffeine-fueled, round the clock overtime
work to kick out your killer startup?
</p>

<p>
Doing moderated amounts of work with a clear focus. Give yourself a
9-5 with occasional crunch times and keep your social life. If you
can't blow off steam and enjoy yourself, you're going to burn out.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Personal Opinions (iffy advice):</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Here's some other advice that I personally think is good but I can't
say if it's 100% the right thing to do. I can expand on anything if
anybody wants more (email me).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>customers are the best investors, they give you money without taking
equity. Start there
</li>
<li>saliency bias is real. if you can contract a designer to beautify
your website before showing to VCs, do it (big money at stake).
</li>
<li>work full-time on the startup, there are way too many things to do,
it's really an all-or-nothing proposition for a major product
</li>
<li>worry about product development not competition, it's not a zero-sum
game for a scrappy startup
</li>
<li>log what happened each week to identify trends and self-correct
</li>
<li>random contracting is rough because developer skills vary
considerably and they don't share your product vision
</li>
<li>get an adviser 3-4 years ahead of you (their wounds are still fresh
and they're probably still doing startup work)
</li>
<li>build a community that provides value to people, ask for help from
the people there for testing or UX interviews (warm intro, product
evangelists, satisfying to solve their problems, fun people to meet
too!, weak network effect)
</li>
<li>know thy customer (where do they hang out?, why do they like you?,
demographic trends, personality trends, etc.)
</li>
<li>never make deals that feel fishy (hires, funding, business partners)
</li>
<li>set company values up front, short-term goals as needed
</li>
<li>set a long-term revenue/customer/funding target on day one and kill
the startup if it doesn't perform (avoid being a zombie startup even
if you're making some money)
</li>
<li>plan growth by orders of magnitude, 0-&gt;1-&gt;10-&gt;100-&gt;1,000-&gt;10,000&#x2026;,
short-term goals change at each milestone, number of customers is a
good metric for this
</li>
<li>internally pick one large, incumbent company in your industry and make
them your target (creates a false equivalency that you're doing good
because you're beating company X on Y thing, morale booster). Find
their weak spots and try to beat them there
</li>
<li>think about the future and try to guess how your industry will have
changed in 30-50 years, build that
</li>
<li>bootstrapped businesses should start niche and grow from there
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Best of luck if you're going after something on your own!</p>
